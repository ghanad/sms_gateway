Overall Goal: Create a Secure, User-Facing "My Messages" Page
Develop a new view, URL, and template within the messaging app that allows an authenticated user to see a paginated list of all SMS messages they have sent, along with their current status.
Task 1: Create the URL Route for the Message History Page
This task defines the web address where users will access their message list.
Sub-task 1.1: Create a urls.py for the messaging app
Create a new file: server-b/messaging/urls.py.
Define a URL pattern for the message list view, for example, path('my-messages/', ..., name='my_messages_list').
Sub-task 1.2: Include the new URLconf in the main project URLs
Open server-b/sms_gateway_project/urls.py.
Add a new include() statement to route a path like /messages/ to the messaging.urls file. For instance: path('messages/', include('messaging.urls')).
Task 2: Implement the View Logic
This task involves writing the Python code to fetch the correct data from the database and prepare it for the template.
Sub-task 2.1: Create the view using a Django Class-Based View
Open server-b/messaging/views.py.
Create a new class-based view, e.g., UserMessageListView, that inherits from LoginRequiredMixin and ListView. Using LoginRequiredMixin ensures only logged-in users can access it.
Sub-task 2.2: Filter the QuerySet to show only the user's own messages
Override the get_queryset method in the view.
Inside this method, filter the Message model records to return only those where the user field matches self.request.user. This is the critical security step to prevent users from seeing each other's data.
Sub-task 2.3: Implement Pagination
Add the paginate_by attribute to the view (e.g., paginate_by = 25) to prevent loading thousands of records at once and to improve performance.
Task 3: Design and Build the Frontend Template
This task focuses on creating the HTML page that will display the message list to the user.
Sub-task 3.1: Create the template file
Create the necessary directory structure: server-b/messaging/templates/messaging/.
Create a new template file inside: message_list.html.
Sub-task 3.2: Structure the template layout
The template should extend the main base.html to inherit the navigation bar and footer.
Add a clear header, such as "My Message History".
Sub-task 3.3: Render the message data in a table
Use a <table> to display the messages.
Iterate through the message_list (or object_list) context variable provided by the ListView.
Display key fields for each message in table columns:
Recipient (message.recipient)
Text (a truncated version of message.text)
Status (message.get_status_display to show the human-readable version)
Provider (message.provider.name)
Date Sent (message.sent_at)
Sub-task 3.4: Add pagination controls
Include the standard Django template code for displaying "Next" and "Previous" page links, and page numbers, using the page_obj context variable.
Task 4: Add Navigation Link to the Main Layout
This final task makes the new page discoverable for logged-in users.
Sub-task 4.1: Update the base template
Open server-b/sms_gateway_project/templates/base.html.
Locate the main navigation bar section.
Add a new link to the "My Messages" page. This link should only be visible if the user is authenticated ({% if user.is_authenticated %}).
Use the Django URL template tag for the link's href: href="{% url 'my_messages_list' %}". This ensures the link will always be correct even if you change the URL path later.
